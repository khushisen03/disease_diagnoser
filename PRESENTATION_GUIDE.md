# Presentation Guide - How to Create PowerPoint

I've created two files for your presentation:

## Files Created:

1. **PROJECT_PRESENTATION.md** - Complete slide content in markdown format
2. **presentation.html** - Visual HTML presentation (can be converted to PPT)

## Method 1: Using the HTML File (Easiest)

### Option A: Print to PDF/PPT
1. Open `presentation.html` in your web browser
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to print
3. Choose "Save as PDF" or "Microsoft Print to PDF"
4. Import the PDF into PowerPoint

### Option B: Screenshot Method
1. Open `presentation.html` in your browser
2. Take screenshots of each slide
3. Insert screenshots into PowerPoint slides

### Option C: Online Conversion
1. Upload `presentation.html` to an online HTML to PPT converter
2. Download the converted PowerPoint file

## Method 2: Manual Creation from Markdown

1. Open `PROJECT_PRESENTATION.md`
2. Open PowerPoint
3. Copy content from each slide section
4. Create slides manually in PowerPoint
5. Apply your preferred design template

## Method 3: Using PowerPoint's Import Feature

1. Open PowerPoint
2. Go to File → Open
3. Try opening `presentation.html` (may need to change file type)
4. PowerPoint may convert it automatically

## Recommended Approach:

**Best Method**: Open `presentation.html` in browser, then:
- Use browser's print feature to save as PDF
- Import PDF into PowerPoint
- Or take screenshots and create slides manually

## Quick Tips:

- The HTML file has 16 slides ready to view
- Each slide is formatted for printing/presentation
- You can customize colors and fonts in the HTML file
- The markdown file has all content organized by slide

## Slide Count:

Total: **16 slides**
- 1 Title slide
- 15 Content slides
- Covers all aspects of your project

Good luck with your presentation! 🎉
